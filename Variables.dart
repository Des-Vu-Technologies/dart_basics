// Variables are containers used to store value in the program.
//There are different types of variables where you can keep different kinds of values.
// Here is an example of creating a variable and initializing it.
void main() {
  var name = "John";
  print(name);
}
// ** here variable name contains value John.

//! Naming Convention For Variables In Dart
/**
 * It is a good habit to follow the naming convention.
 *  In Dart Variables, the variable name should start with lower-case,
 *  and every second word’s first letter will be upper-case like num1, fullName, isMarried, etc. 
 * Technically, this naming convention is called lowerCamelCase.

/**
 *  There is no right or wrong way to name a file. 
 * However, you can follow a specific case style to ensure consistent naming across your organization.
 *  These cases differ based on how they combine different words into a single string. 
 * Let’s take a loot at some of the popular ones.

Camel Case (camelCase)
This involves capitalizing all words except the first word and removing the space in between them.
For instance, public domain software can be written as publicDomainSoftware.

Pascal Case (PascalCase)
This involves capitalizing all words in the name, including the first, and removing the space in between them.
For instance, public domain software can be written as PublicDomainSoftware.

Snake Case (snake_case)
This type of naming combines words simply by replacing the space with an underscore (_). 
The same example used above can be written as public_domain_software.

Kebab Case (kebab-case)
This is similar to the snake case except the underscore is replaced with a dash (-).
For the file name used above, the Kebab case name can be written as public-domain-software.

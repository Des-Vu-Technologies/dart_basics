Dart provides a variety of built-in functions that are important for various programming tasks. Here are some other important built-in functions in Dart:

```

1. **String Functions:**

   - `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`: Convert a string to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.
   - `trim()`, `trimLeft()`, and `trimRight()`: Remove whitespace from the beginning or end of a string.
   - `contains()`: Check if a string contains a substring.
   - `replaceAll()`: Replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring.
   - `split()`: Split a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.

2. **List Functions:**

   - `add()`: Add an element to the end of a list.
   - `addAll()`: Add all elements from another list to the current list.
   - `remove()`: Remove the first occurrence of a specific element from a list.
   - `removeAt()`: Remove an element at a specific index in a list.
   - `indexOf()`: Find the index of the first occurrence of a specific element in a list.
   - `sort()`: Sort the elements of a list.
   - `forEach()`: Iterate over the elements of a list.

3. **Map Functions:**

   - `putIfAbsent()`: Add a key-value pair to a map if the key doesn't exist.
   - `remove()`: Remove a key-value pair from a map.
   - `containsKey()` and `containsValue()`: Check if a map contains a specific key or value.
   - `keys` and `values`: Get the keys and values of a map as iterable collections.

4. **Iterable Functions:**

   - `map()`: Transform each element of an iterable into another value and return a new iterable.
   - `where()`: Filter elements in an iterable based on a condition and return a new iterable.
   - `reduce()`: Combine elements of an iterable into a single value using a specified function.

5. **Type Conversion Functions:**
   - `int.parse()`, `double.parse()`: Parse strings to convert them to integers or doubles.
   - `toString()`: Convert a value to a string.
   - `isNotEmpty`: Check if a string or collection is not empty.
6. **File and I/O Functions:**

   - `File()`: Create and manipulate files in Dart.
   - `Directory()`: Create and manipulate directories in Dart.
   - `stdin.readLineSync()`: Read input from the console.

7. **Async and Future Functions:**

   - `Future`: Represents a potentially long-running operation that may complete with a value or an error.
   - `async` and `await`: Used to work with asynchronous operations.
   - `Future.then()` and `Future.catchError()`: Handle the results or errors of asynchronous operations.

8. **DateTime Functions:**

   - `DateTime.now()`: Get the current date and time.
   - `DateTime.parse()`: Parse a string to create a DateTime object.
   - `DateTime.add()` and `DateTime.subtract()`: Add or subtract time intervals from DateTime objects.

9. **Assertion Functions:**
   - `assert()`: Used for debugging and testing to check if a condition is true; if false, it throws an AssertionError.

These are just some of the important built-in functions and methods available in Dart. Depending on your programming needs, you may use these functions to perform a wide range of tasks, from string manipulation and data transformation to working with collections and asynchronous operations.

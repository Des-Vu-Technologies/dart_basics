 * Here, `$variableName` is used to join variables.
 * This joining process in Dart is called string interpolation.
 * 
 * **String Interpolation** is the act of adding a variable into a string, making sure it gets evaluated when the string does.
 * 
 * It differs from **string concatenation** in that it dynamically injects the value of the variable into the string.

`async` and `await` are essential keywords in Dart's asynchronous programming model. They make it easier to write asynchronous code that appears more like traditional synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability. Here's an overview of `async` and `await` in Dart:

1. **`async` Keyword**:
   - The `async` keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous. When you mark a function as `async`, it means the function can use `await` to pause its execution and allow other tasks to run while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.

2. **`await` Keyword**:
   - The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause the execution of that function until a `Future` or `Stream` completes.
   - When an `await` expression is encountered, the function yields control to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run.
   - After the awaited operation completes, the function resumes execution, and the result of the `Future` or `Stream` is assigned to the variable on the left side of `await`.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - You can use a `try-catch` block around `await` expressions to handle exceptions thrown during asynchronous operations.
   - Alternatively, you can use `.catchError()` with the `then` method of a `Future` to handle errors.

Here's an example of using `async` and `await` to fetch and process data asynchronously:

```dart
import 'dart:async';

// Simulate an asynchronous data loading operation
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Simulate a delay
  return 'Data loaded successfully';
}

// Process the fetched data
String processData(String data) {
  return 'Processed: $data';
}

void main() async {
  print('Start of main');
  
  try {
    // Start the asynchronous operation and wait for it to complete
    final result = await fetchData();
    final processedResult = processData(result);

    print(processedResult); // This will be printed after the delay
  } catch (error) {
    print('Error: $error');
  }

  print('End of main');
}
```

In this example:

- We define an asynchronous function `fetchData` that simulates data loading with a 2-second delay.
- We have a function `processData` that processes the fetched data.
- In the `main` function, we mark it as `async` and use `await` to wait for the `fetchData` operation to complete.
- We handle any errors using a `try-catch` block.
- After `fetchData` completes, we process the data using `processData`, and the result is printed.

This demonstrates how `async` and `await` allow you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations in Dart.

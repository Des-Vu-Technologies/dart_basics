/**
 * Here $variableName is used to join variables.
 *  This joining process in dart is called string interpolation.
 * !!The act of adding a variable into a string, making sure it gets evaluated when the string does.
 * !string concatenation as gluing strings together.
 * ! And, you can think of string interpolation without strings as injecting strings inside of other strings.

# Dart Built-In Data Types

Data types help categorize the different types of data used in your code. They specify the type of value that can be stored in a variable. In Dart, there are several built-in data types:

1. **Numbers:** These include integer and floating-point numbers. For example:
   - `int age = 30;`
   - `double price = 29.99;`

2. **Strings:** Strings are used to represent text. For example:
   - `String name = "DÃ¨s Vu";`

3. **Booleans:** Booleans represent true or false values. For example:
   - `bool isOpen = true;`

4. **Lists:** Lists are ordered collections that can hold multiple values of the same or different types. For example:
   - `List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];`

5. **Maps:** Maps are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value. For example:
   - `Map<String, dynamic> person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30};`

6. **Sets:** Sets are collections that store unique values. They do not allow duplicate elements. For example:
   - `Set<String> uniqueColors = {"red", "green", "blue"};`

7. **Runes:** Runes are used to represent Unicode characters. Dart provides support for internationalization and character encoding. For example:
   - `Runes heart = new Runes('\u2665');`

8. **Null:** The `null` type represents the absence of a value. Variables can be assigned the value `null` to indicate the absence of data. For example:
   - `String? nullableString = null;`

These built-in data types in Dart allow you to work with various kinds of data efficiently in your programs.

##  The data type classification is as given below:

| Data Type | Keyword | Description                                     |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Numbers   | int, double, num | Represents numeric values                 |
| Strings   | String  | Represents a sequence of characters            |
| Booleans  | bool    | Represents Boolean values `true` and `false`   |
| Lists     | List    | An ordered group of items                      |
| Maps      | Map     | Represents a set of values as key-value pairs  |
| Sets      | Set     | An unordered list of unique values of the same type |
| Runes     | runes   | Represents Unicode values of Strings           |
| Null      | null    | Represents a null value                        |

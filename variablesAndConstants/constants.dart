/**
 * Constant is the type of variable whose value never changes.
 *  In programming, changeable values are mutable and unchangeable values are immutable.
 *  Sometimes, you donâ€™t need to change the value once declared. 
 * Like the value of PI=3.14, it never changes. 
 * To create a constant in Dart, you can use the const keyword.

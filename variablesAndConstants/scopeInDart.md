```
Scope in Dart refers to the region or context within which a variable or identifier is accessible and can be used. Dart has two main types of scope.

```
1. **Global Scope**: Variables or identifiers declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the Dart program, including within functions, classes, and other scopes. Global scope variables are defined outside of any function or class.

   ```dart
   // Global scope variable
   int globalVar = 42;

   void main() {
     // Accessing globalVar from within the main function
     print(globalVar);
   }
   ```

2. **Local Scope**: Local scope refers to the context within a block of code, such as a function or a loop. Variables or identifiers declared within a local scope are only accessible within that scope. They are not visible or accessible from outside that scope.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     // Local scope variable
     int localVar = 10;

     // Accessing localVar from within the main function
     print(localVar);
   }
   ```

   In this example, `localVar` is a local scope variable within the `main` function.

### Block Scope:

Dart has block scope, which means that variables declared within a block (inside curly braces `{}`) are only accessible within that block. This applies to if statements, for loops, and other code blocks:

```dart
void main() {
  if (true) {
    // Block scope variable
    int blockVar = 5;

    // Accessing blockVar within the block
    print(blockVar);
  }

  // Attempting to access blockVar outside the block will result in an error
  // print(blockVar); // Uncommenting this line would result in an error
}
```

In this example, `blockVar` is accessible only within the `if` block and cannot be accessed outside of it.

### Function Scope:

Variables declared within a function are said to have function scope. They are accessible only within that function:

```dart
void main() {
  // Function scope variable
  int functionVar = 20;

  // Accessing functionVar within the main function
  print(functionVar);

  anotherFunction();
}

void anotherFunction() {
  // Attempting to access functionVar here will result in an error
  // print(functionVar); // Uncommenting this line would result in an error
}
```

In this example, `functionVar` is a variable with function scope, and it is accessible only within the `main` function. Attempting to access it in `anotherFunction` would result in an error.

Understanding scope is essential in Dart programming, as it helps you manage variable visibility and avoid naming conflicts between different parts of your code. Variables declared in narrower scopes take precedence over variables in broader scopes when there are naming conflicts.

## Variables in Dart

Variables are containers used to store values in a program. Dart supports different types of variables to store various kinds of values. Here's an example of creating a variable and initializing it in Dart:

```dart
void main() {
  var name = "John";
  print(name);
}
```

In this example, the variable `name` contains the value "John."

## Naming Convention for Variables in Dart

It's a good practice to follow naming conventions for variables. In Dart, variable names should start with a lowercase letter, and for every subsequent word, the first letter should be capitalized. This convention is known as `lowerCamelCase`. For example, `num1`, `fullName`, and `isMarried` are valid variable names following this convention.

## File Naming Conventions

File naming conventions help ensure consistency in naming files across your organization. Here are some popular cases:

### Camel Case (`camelCase`)

Camel case capitalizes all words except the first word and removes spaces between them. For instance, "public domain software" can be written as `publicDomainSoftware`.

### Pascal Case (`PascalCase`)

Pascal case capitalizes all words in the name, including the first word, and removes spaces between them. For instance, "public domain software" can be written as `PublicDomainSoftware`.

### Snake Case (`snake_case`)

Snake case combines words by replacing spaces with underscores (`_`). Using the same example, "public domain software" becomes `public_domain_software`.

### Kebab Case (`kebab-case`)

Kebab case is similar to snake case, but it replaces spaces with dashes (`-`). The file name "public domain software" in kebab case is `public-domain-software`.
